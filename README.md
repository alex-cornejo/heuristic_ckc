abstract = {The uniform capacitated vertex k-center problem is an ùí©ùí´-hard combinatorial optimization problem that models real situations where k centers can only attend a maximum number of customers, and the travel time or distance from the customers to their assigned center has to be minimized. This article introduces a polynomial-time constructive heuristic algorithm that exploits the relationship between this problem and the minimum capacitated dominating set problem. The proposed heuristic is based on the one-hop farthest-first heuristic that has proven effective for the uncapacitated version of the problem. We carried out different empirical evaluations of the proposed heuristic, including an analysis of the effect of a parallel implementation of the algorithm, which significantly improved the running time for relatively large instances.},

**If this implementation is useful for you, please cite our paper.
This implementation should be used just for research/academic purposes.**

The following instructions were tested for Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS.

## Install c++ boost libraries
```
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```

## Install cmake
```
sudo apt install cmake
```

## Install MPICH for parallel computing
```
sudo apt install libmpich-dev
```

## Compile program
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cmake --build .
```
The binary file will be generated onto the root folder with the name ```heuristic_ckc```

## Run
```
./heuristic_ckc [file] [n] [k] [L] [ind_rep] [rep] [print] [instance_format]
```

## Where,

|  Parameter |                                          Description                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[file]` | (string) Instance file path with a valid format, defined here                                    |
| `[n]`    | (integer) Number of vertices.  |
| `[k]`    | (integer) Number of centers.   |
| `[L]`    | (integer) Uniform capacity.    |
| `[ind_rep]`    | (integer) Independent repetitions of the algorithm, for sensitivity analysis. |
| `[rep]`    | (integer) Number of repetitions of the algorithm. The best found solution is returned by the algorithm. |
| `[print]`    | (string) If true, prints the solutions. Otherwise, only prints the solution size. |
| `[instance_format]`    | (string) Type of instance to use ('tsplib' or 'orlib' are supported only in the examples format). |

## Example 1
```
./heuristic_ckc dataset/URDI/URDI-3000/URDI-3000-01.tsp 3000 20 149 10 1 false tsplib
