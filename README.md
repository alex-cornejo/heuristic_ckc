# ckc-heuristic
A constructive heuristic for the Capacitated Vertex K-Center Problem

The first time it is need to install the conan package manager with the respective libraries included in the conanfile.txt

# Install conan and libraries

```
pip3 install conan
```

## Reload local path
```
source ~/.profile
```

## Compiler configuration for GCC compiler >= 5.1 :
```
conan profile new default --detect
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```

## Install conan libraries
```
mkdir build && cd build
conan install ..
```

NOTE: Previous steps only are needed to be executed once. Once conan libraries are installed, to compile and run the program, get back to the root project folder with ```cd ..```

# Install cmake
```
sudo apt install cmake
```

# Install MPICH for parallel computing
```
sudo apt install libmpich-dev
```

# Compile program

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
$ cmake --build .
```
The binary file will be generated onto the "bin/" folder. Get onto it with ```cd bin/```

# Run

```
$ ./ckc_heuristic [file] [n] [k] [L] [ind_rep] [rep] [print] [instance_format]
```

|  Parameter |                                          Description                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[file]` | (string) Instance file path with a valid format, defined here                                    |
| `[n]`    | (integer) Number of vertices  |
| `[k]`    | (integer) Number of centers   |
| `[L]`    | (integer) Uniform capacity    |
| `[ind_rep]`    | (integer) Independent repetitions of the algorithm, for sensitivity analysis |
| `[rep]`    | (integer) Number of repetions of the algorithm. The best of rep is returned by the algorithm. |
| `[print]`    | (string) If true, prints the solutions (centers and assigned centers). Otherwise, only prints the solution size |
| `[instance_format]`    | (string) Type of instance to use ('tsplib' or 'orlib' are supported). |
